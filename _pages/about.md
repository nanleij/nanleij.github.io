I am a PhD student at Delft University of Technology, under supervision of David de Laat. I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Applied Physics and a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Applied Mathematics at Delft University of Technology.

Currently, I am mostly interested in applying semidefinite programming and polynomial optimization techniques to problems in discrete geometry, such as the kissing number problem or the sphere packing problem.
